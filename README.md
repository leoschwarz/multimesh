# multimesh

The goal of this Rust crate is to provide generic readers and writers for various mesh formats. Through a set of traits it becomes possible to directly deserialize into and serialize any custom mesh representation.

## Status

Early work in progress, code is ugly and I'm prototyping an ergonomic API.
