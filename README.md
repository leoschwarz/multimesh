# multimesh

The goal of this Rust crate is to provide generic readers and writers for various mesh formats.
A set of traits enables serialization and deserialization of any mesh data structures.

## Status

Work in progress. The API has it's rough spots, file format support has yet to be added and will likely uncover multiple
areas where the traits will have to be changed, so don't depend on this crate yet.
